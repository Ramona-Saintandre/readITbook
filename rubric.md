 <h1 class= title >JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS </h1>

<p>The JavaScript Project is an opportunity for bootcamp students to:  

●Begin to pull together many different things they’ve learned so far.

●Work on a more extensive and more complicated case study than labs and exercises as preludes to the Angular Project and Final Project.

●Collaborate with teammates on a software project, experiencing the need for proper version control and project management The majority of 3 days will be committed to the project (although outside work may still be required) and there will be multiple check-ins during those days to make sure groups are on-track.

The entire group will work together on one of the three projects. Take a little time to decide which one you want to tackle, because once you get started, you cannot move to another project. </p>

 <h2>Possible projects:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memory Game</li> 
<li>Point-Of-Sale Website</li> 
<li>Point-Of-Sale Website</li> 
</ul>

<p>See the following pages for more information on each project.
Please recognize that the descriptions are minimum versions; it’s hoped each group will go beyond these requirements and incorporate features of interest to them.</p>

<h3 class =important>ALL CHOICES MUST BE MADE MOBILE FIRST AND MUST ALSO INCLUDE A DESKTOP LAYOUT.</h3>

 <h3> MEMORY GAME</H3>
<section class=italic>
 We all remember the classic memory game where we had to choose two cards at a time to see if they match, right? Good! You’re building this.  
At a minimum, this game should include:</p>

<p> 
●A game board that displays all of the current cards face down in a random order.
●A start button that will initiate the game. 
●Cards must “flip” or “turn” when the user clicks on them.
●If a pair of matching cards has been selected,remove the cards from the playing board after a short time.
●If a pair of cards does not match, they should flip back to being face down after a short time.
●Must include a reset button which will reset the game board.  
●Display a timer that will notify the user how long it took them to complete the game.
●For flipping the cards, do not use any libraries or plugins.
